## Review

Lately, I have stopped reading & am trying to pick the habit up again. After watching a video on YouTube about the user's favourite books of all time, I created another to-read list! This time I took a resolution to only start other books after finishing the books in this list! The picture of Dorian Gray topped this list and its available in the nearby library.

My first impression after reading 2, 3 pages was - "Woah! the content is very dense". Author used a lot of words to describe things indirectly using analogies. Felt like another painful journey I have to go through to finish the book. Felt like there is a lot of filler material

But all this changed after a character named _Lord Henry_ entered the scenes. His ideologies or the wording of them seemed very interesting. His every sentence felt quotable. Most of his thoughts are absurd, beautiful, deep, and cntradictory at the same time. When he was in scenes, which happened throughout the book, there is a smile on my face. I became more attentive to what he is saying and his words actually made me stop reading and think- which happens very very rarely these days

The first interaction between Henry & Dorian sets the core of the story and is in essence the whole summary of the book. The importance of beauty, youth, and pleasures - this conversation/though process made me install dating apps and to start looking at romance/sex as not so bad thing afterall! I became more sensual? or maybe I started accepting the fact that its not bad/immoral to pursue sensual pleasures.

As the book progressed I got used the story and started skimming through Henry's ideologies. The enging wasn't a banger to me. But, I was expecting the Sibyl's brother to kill Dorian and was surprised to see him dead before doing so. I actually rooted for him and expecting a painful death for Dorian. Also, killing of Basil felt wrong and bad on so many levels. But, I can see where Dorian has gone by then.

Not sure what the ending exactly means. I think its an anology. Dorian is not able to look at the darker side of him (the picture) and finally decided to pierce it with a knife.

Also, Sibyl Vane! Older me might have cried for her and vouched for her on a deeper level. But, it actually felt wrong to kill herself for some worthless person in the name of love. I think this reflects how my view towards love (& suffering for it) is changing over time. Definitely I was a different person when I read "If its not forver its not love"

## Quotes

1. You never say a moral thing and you never do a wrong thing

2. The worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic

3. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.

4. Dorian: "I don't want to see him (Basil) alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good advice.
   Henry: "People are very fond of giving away what they need most themeselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity"

5. There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.
