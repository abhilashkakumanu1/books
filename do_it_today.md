_About This Book_ =>
The recipe for a good life is simple: Get clear on what you want and eliminate everything else from your life.

_About This Book_ =>
When you complain every day, eat junk food, and never work out, those things add up too. That’s how we become miserable. You almost never hear about how one single moment destroyed a person’s life. Of course, tragedies happen. But for the majority of us, we simply let life slip away from us. We decide not to do it today. Because “what’s the point?” Well, here’s the point: Life is good if you know how to live it.

_Do It Today, Not Tomorrow_ =>
Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.

_What I Do When I Can’t Focus_ =>
You and I both know that those things can’t interrupt you without your permission. That means every time you’re not focused; you’re giving someone or something permission to enter your mind. Scary, isn’t it?

_What I Do When I Can’t Focus_ =>
What thing(s) should I eliminate to make my life so simple that it’s easy to focus?

_How To Beat Procrastination (backed by science)_ =>
Willpower Doesn’t Work. Systems Do. What you really need is a system for doing work. A lot of people shy away from routines, systems and frameworks because they want to have “freedom.” I’m sorry to disappoint you: Freedom is your enemy. The fact is that, if you want to get things done, you need rules. What are some things that research proved to be effective? Self-imposed deadlines. Accountability systems (commitment with friends, or a coach). Working/studying in intervals. Exercising 30 minutes a day. A healthy diet. Eliminating distractions. And most importantly: Internal motivation.

_The Habits Of Unproductive People You Don’t Want To Copy_ =>
Checking is a habit that you can never fully eliminate. I still follow the NBA because I like it. Pick only 1 or 2 “checking” vices you actually like. Eliminate the rest. You’re not missing anything anyway.

_The Habits Of Unproductive People You Don’t Want To Copy_ =>
Solving a problem requires a weird combination of freedom and constraint. Whenever I hear “Just have fun with it” or “Think outside the box,” I know from experience that things are about to turn into a colossal waste of time

_Why Disconnecting From The Internet Improves Your Focus_ =>
Your attention is all over the place, but not at the right place. As the Stoic philosopher Seneca once said: “To be everywhere is to be nowhere.”

_Why Disconnecting From The Internet Improves Your Focus_ =>
Too much love? You will smother people. - Wow..this sounds familiar? Congested”

_The Single Biggest Reason Most People Procrastinate In Life_ =>
This is what I believed: “Work is something you don’t like to do — you just do it because you need money and status.” Sadly, many of us believe that is the truth. Fortunately, my procrastination behavior changed this year. It wasn’t some kind of magical productivity hack or software that turned me into a productivity machine. I’m more productive and focused than ever. And I’m more satisfied with my work than in the past. Do you want to know the secret? I’m finally doing something that I love.

_The Single Biggest Reason Most People Procrastinate In Life_ =>
We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives are either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.

_The Single Biggest Reason Most People Procrastinate In Life_ =>
You may delay, but time will not.

_This Ancient Habit Will Maximize Your Focus_ =>
“Let’s go.” That’s my mantra. I’ve trained myself to say it every morning when I wake up. It really energizes me. I wake up and immediately say, “Let’s go.”

_This Ancient Habit Will Maximize Your Focus_ =>
Everyone spends time thinking about things that will never happen. Because that’s what fear is. Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher, said it best: “My life has been full of terrible misfortunes most of which never happened.”

_How To Focus Better: Manage Your Attention (not your time)_ =>
Beware the barrenness of a busy life.

_How Perfectionism Is Destroying Your Productivity_ =>
If you’re a perfectionist, you’re just a procrastinator with a mask. It’s no different from someone who’s lazy and does nothing at all. Don’t believe me? Let’s take a look. A perfectionist… Always waits for the right moment. Never makes mistakes. Always needs more time. But at the end of the day, life and work are about outcomes. Results matter. And if you’re a perfectionist, you might get the outcomes some day. But the question is: When? And, at what cost? Research specifically shows that perfectionism is closely related to depression and low self-esteem.

_How Perfectionism Is Destroying Your Productivity_ =>
Do great work like a perfectionist, but don’t give too much attention to your goals like a slacker. And finally, combine it with this: Resourcefulness — Goals can work well, but they can also be counterproductive. That’s why you want to rely on systems. And when shit hits the fan; use your problem-solving skills to figure things out.

_How To Read 100 Books A Year_ =>
Read books that are close to what’s going on in your life. There’s a book for everything you can think off. People are writing books for 2000 years, and there have been plenty of people in your shoes: struggling teen, aspiring artist, broke entrepreneur, new parent, etc. Don’t waste your time reading about subjects you have zero interest in. Instead, pick out the books that are related to your profession or hobby. Read books about people that you admire. Don’t read a book just because it’s a best-seller or a classic if it has no meaning to you.

_20 Things That Will Make You More Productive Than Ever_ =>
When people say: “I’m thinking.” They mean worrying by thinking. Don’t think too much. Just DO, and see what happens. If you like what you’re seeing, continue. If not, do something else.

_20 Things That Will Make You More Productive Than Ever_ =>
A few things are vital in life: Food, water, shelter, relationships, and exercise. Without this stuff you can’t function properly. Scientific research shows that regular exercise can make you happier, smarter, and more energetic.

_If You Can Believe It, You Can Achieve It_ =>
Belief, on the other hand, is a tool that’s extremely useful. And it’s underutilized by many. The problem is that most of us lack belief. And when I talk about belief, I talk about it from a practical point of view. I’m not talking about hope or faith. I don’t believe that you can “hope” for the best, sit back and wait until good things happen to you. Hope is not a strategy for life. I prefer to look at facts and make conclusions like a pragmatist. Like it or not, but everything that’s floating in that head of yours is there because you believe it. “Life sucks.” “I’m not good at my job.” “I can never find my dream job.” “No one loves me.” “I will never become successful.” See? It’s all there because you believe those things. William James, one of the primary figures associated with pragmatism, put it best: “Belief will help create the fact.”

_Don’t Compete. Create!_ =>
“You get rid of the thought of competition. You are to create, not to compete for what is already created. You do not have to take anything away from any one.”

_Don’t Compete. Create!_ =>
We fear that we lose our clients, business, contracts, attention—and that we lose everything we worked so hard for as a result. But that’s exactly the problem. Fear begets fear. When you’re afraid that you won’t be able to grow, what will happen? Exactly, you won’t grow! - Is this what is happening to me? I am afraid that this is the peak of my career/life and its downhill since then..maybe I should change that mindset and see what’s gonna happen!

_All Strength Comes From Repetition_ =>
One thing we have to remind ourselves is that the people who think they know everything are the biggest losers in life.

_How I Measure My Life_ =>
You rarely hear that successful people measure their life by the size of their bank account or any other conventional measure. Instead, people who‘re considered successful in the eye of society often look at these 3 factors: Energy Work Relationships

_How I Measure My Life_ =>
In order to really find happiness, you need to continue looking for opportunities that you believe are meaningful, in which you will be able to learn new things, to succeed, and be given more and more responsibility to shoulder.

_How I Measure My Life_ =>
“How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours,” as the late Wayne Dyer said. Instead of looking at how others treat you, measure how much time and energy you put into your relationships. That’s the only thing you can control. My experience is that when you make time for the people that matter to you, the relationships improve. And if they do not, the relationship was probably not meant to be. We simply have to move on. The real lesson here is that we always must focus on what we can control.

_The Power Of Compounding_ =>
When I was preparing for my final exams, I decided to study only one subject at a time. And I only moved on to the next when I fully grasped the material. I noticed that I could learn something way faster if I immersed myself in it for a few days. Most of my peers studied multiple subjects a day. I never like that approach because it’s too scattered. If I’m working on a project at work, I don’t pick up another big project. If I’m working on a new course for my blog, I don’t start writing a book at the same time. That strategy helps me to get things done quicker and better. Hence, I achieve much more when I give my attention to one thing.

_The Power Of Compounding_ =>
Another thing: Buffett acquired 99% of his net worth after he became 50. Think about all those spoiled idiots in their teens, twenties, and even thirties (me included), who complain about the slow progress of their career. This helps you to put things in perspective
